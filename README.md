Afterwards, configure the AWS Credentials locally and add the S3 Bucket that you will use for the demo (note: the bucket must be created and it must have the required permissions already):

```bash
# Replace the values with the ones accordingly to your AWS Account...
export S3_BUCKET="your-bucket-name-goes-here"
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="paste-your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="paste-your-secret-access-key"
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="paste-your-session-token"
```

Finally, proceed to run the application as follows:

```bash
streamlit run  src/image_detect_famous/image_detect_famous_app.py --server.port 8080
```
